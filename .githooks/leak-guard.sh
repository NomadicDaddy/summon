# Re-leak guard for the public repository (two tiers).
#
# Tier 1 (tracked, below): generic high-signal secret formats and
# home-directory path shapes. Nothing machine- or fleet-specific.
# Tier 2 (untracked): private literals loaded from
#   ${LEAK_GUARD_PATTERNS:-$HOME/.config/leak-guard/patterns}
# (extended regexes, one per line; blank lines and # comments ignored).
# Seeded by .githooks/leak-guard-setup.sh (runs via the `prepare` script).
# If the file is absent the guard warns and runs tier 1 only.
#
# Scans staged ADDITIONS only. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify` for a
# confirmed false positive.
#
# Keep this file byte-identical between the aidd, spernakit, and starsync
# repos, and in sync with scripts/check-leak-guard.sh.

# Tier 1a, PEM: the header is checked separately because it is the one secret format whose
# giveaway string is also a legitimate constant. A config validator compares an incoming key
# against it and documentation shows the shape a key takes, so the header on its own says
# "a key goes here", not "a key is here". Blocking it blocks the template that ships those
# files: `git init && git add -A` stages every one of them as an addition, and a scaffolded
# project could not make its first commit.
#
# The leak is the key material, so that is what has to be present: base64 following the header
# on the same line (a one-line JSON or .env value) or a whole added line of nothing but base64
# (a pasted key body). A placeholder remainder like `\n...` or `',` matches neither. The header
# does not have to belong to this commit; the body is what leaks.

# whichever one is being committed to right now. A repository cannot leak its own identity to
# itself: the name is already its directory, its remote URL, and its package name, and it says it
# constantly in its own prose. Drop the patterns that fire on this repo's own name and keep the
# rest, so a private app still guards its siblings' names while being free to write its own.
# Without this the guard is unusable in a private app, which is why it was confined to the public
# repos before. A pattern that grep cannot compile is kept rather than dropped: fail closed.
